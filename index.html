      <strong>GitAhead</strong> is a graphical Git client designed to help you
      understand and manage your history. It features a fast native interface
      that shows you more of what you want to see, <em>your source code</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitAhead was designed by <a href="https://scitools.com">SciTools</a>,
      the makers of <a href="https://scitools.com/features/">Understand</a>.
      It has all of the features you expect from a commercial quality client,
      now completely free and open source.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git provideds a wealth of historical information that, too often, goes
      largely unexploited because it's too cumbersome to explore with other
      tools. We believe that when you understand your history you'll make
      better choices today!
