      <strong>GitAhead</strong> is a graphical Git client for Windows, Linux
      and macOS. It features a fast native interface designed to help you
      understand and manage your source code history.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitAhead was designed by <a href="https://scitools.com">SciTools&trade;</a>,
      the makers of <a href="https://scitools.com/features/">Understand&trade;</a>.
      It has all of the features you expect from a commercial quality client,
      now completely free and open source.

      Git provides a wealth of historical information that, too often, goes
      unexploited because it's cumbersome to explore with other tools. We
      believe that when you understand your history you'll make better
      choices today!

<h5>Please Note!</h5>
<p>
  GitAhead is no longer under active development. Low-level maintenance and bug
  fix releases will be made as necessary for the forseeable future, but no new
  features or major changes are planned at this time.
